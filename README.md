# First FPS

## Purpose
This is a small project to learn about unity development.

The tutorial I'm following can be found in a pdf form from [this website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/build-your-own-first-person-shooter-in-unity/)

It's basically creating a COD zombie survival style game.

## Issues

I'm having an issue following the tutorial. I'm at a point where I should be able to fire a bullet (a capsule in unity terms) from my player, and when it hits the zombie/enemy (another capsule) the bullet should vanish/destroy. Right now it's just kinda rolling off the zombie and then continuing on into the void for a few seconds, after which it then gets destroyed.

My thoughts are that it's probably something to do with the scripts attached to the bullet, or some setting with one of the meshes on the bullet or the enemy.
